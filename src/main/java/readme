|         libusb-ftdi - a JAVA USB driver for FTDI serial UART chips.          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This software is based upon libFTDI: a FTDI USB driver (written in C) with bitbang
  mode support. libFTDI is an open source library to talk to FTDI chips: FT232BM,
  FT245BM, FT2232C, FT2232D, FT245R and FT232H including the popular bitbang mode.
  The library is linked with user programs in userspace, no kernel driver required.
  libFTDI works with Linux, Windows, MacOS X and BSD variants thanks to libusb.
